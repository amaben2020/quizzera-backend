The Model component represents the data, database interactions, and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for implementing the core business rules and application logic and also focuses on CRUD operations, data validation, and maintaining data integrity.

the business logic defines the behavior and operations of the application, ensuring that it operates according to the requirements and objectives of the business or organization it serves. It is typically implemented within the application's codebase, often separated from the user interface to promote modularity and maintainability.
